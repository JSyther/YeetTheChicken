## 🎮 About The Project

**Yeet The Chicken** is a ridiculous, open-sourced Unreal Engine project focused on over-the-top chicken yeeting mechanics.  
Designed as a creative and chaotic playground, this game invites players to build and trigger absurd physics-based contraptions to launch a very durable chicken across wild landscapes.

Whether you're learning Unreal Engine, prototyping wild game ideas, or just into hilarious ragdoll antics — this project is for you.
