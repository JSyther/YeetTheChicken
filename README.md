## 🎮 About The Project

**Yeet The Chicken** is a ridiculous, open-sourced Unreal Engine project focused on over-the-top chicken yeeting mechanics.  
Designed as a creative and chaotic playground, this game invites players to build and trigger absurd physics-based contraptions to launch a very durable chicken across wild landscapes.

Whether you're learning Unreal Engine, prototyping wild game ideas, or just into hilarious ragdoll antics — this project is for you.

## ⚙️ Open Collaboration

🎯 **This is a non-commercial, open-source project.**  
We welcome **all Unreal Engine developers** — from beginners to veterans — to contribute, experiment, and have fun.

> Want to improve visuals, physics, or chaos? Go for it.  
> Fork it, mod it, break it — just don’t try to sell it.
